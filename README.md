# NeuralNetworkDoodles
A mini-neural network project which involves building a neural network from the ground-up, and training the network in recognising specific doodles.


# How to Use
`data.txt` contains a certain number of doodles. Upon running `main.py`,  the network will be created and trained on these sets of doodles, which, for now, only contain circles, crosses and triangles. To use the paint function, left click to paint, right click to erase, and middle click to process the doodle.

# Training
Doodles will be fed into the network upon running `main.py`. A real-time animated graph will be plotted to test and measure the effectiveness of the neural network through deviations from the "correct" answers.

# Testing
After training, the program will prompt the user to draw a doodle. Simply pick a shape out of: Circle, Triangle, Cross and line. The network will then guess the shape you have chosen to doodle.

As mentioned, hold the left mouse button to paint, right click to erase, and middle click to process the doodle.
