# NeuralNetworkDoodles
A mini-neural network project which involves building a neural network from the ground-up, and training the network in recognising specific doodles.


# How to Use
`data.txt` contains a certain number of doodles. Upon running `main.py`,  the network will be created and trained on these sets of doodles, which, for now, only contain circles, crosses and triangles. To use the paint function, left click to paint, right click to erase, and middle click to process the doodle.
